## Tasks

Tasks are building blocks that allow to specify what a model should "do". Like other model building blocks, they can be combined using the `+` operator. 
However, they should not be added to a model but rather provided via the `tasks=` argument to the render function, e.g.,    

```r
render(m, tasks = tsk_estimation() +
   tsk_output_xpose4())
```
