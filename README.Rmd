# assemblerr

assemblerr is an R package to construct pharmacometric models by combining pre-defined model components. It's intended to simplify the specification of complex pharmacometric models and provide a mechanism to generate models in an automatic way. With assemblerr, models are specified using R code and then converted to a NONMEM control stream.   

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UUPharmacometrics/assemblerr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
